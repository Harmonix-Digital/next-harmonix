            <p className="">Before Harmony, Zenith co‚Äôs sales process was entirely manual. The sales team spent hours each week sending outreach emails and cold-calling prospects with very little return. Their conversion rate hovered around 8%, and lead quality was inconsistent. The leadership team knew they needed a more scalable, efficient solution to compete in their market.</p>

            <p className="font-bold text-xl mb-3">The Harmony Solution</p>
            <p className="">Zenith co deployed CA$H ‚Äì the AI Sales Closer. Within minutes, they connected their CRM, synced email accounts, and customized the AI to match their brand's tone of voice. CA$H began prospecting small businesses, sending personalized outreach campaigns, and automatically handling common objections like pricing and feature comparisons. The AI worked around the clock, qualifying leads and scheduling calls directly into the team's calendar. What once required hours of manual effort was now fully automated, freeing the team to focus on closing deals and product development.</p>

            <div className="">Within just two months, the results were clear:
              <ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
                <li>Zenith co's conversion rate increased from 8% to 16%, effectively doubling their sales efficiency.</li>
                <li>The team reported saving 10+ hours per week, previously wasted on repetitive outreach tasks.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, revenue from new clients grew by 35%, creating momentum that positioned Zenith co ahead of competitors.</li>
              </ul>


              <p>One of the sales managers shared:</p>
              üí¨ ‚ÄúCA$H transformed our entire approach to sales. Instead of burning time on cold emails that went nowhere, we had qualified leads booked straight into our calendar. Harmony didn‚Äôt just save us time ‚Äî it helped us grow faster than we thought possible.‚Äù
