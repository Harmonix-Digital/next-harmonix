            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">1. What is Harmonix?</span>
          </p>
          <p>Harmonix is a digital marketplace where developers can create, list, and sell AI-powered agents and tools. Buyers can explore, purchase, and deploy these agents for business, personal, or creative use.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">2. How do I create an account?</span>
          </p>
          <p>To create an account:</p>
          <p>1. Click <strong>Sign Up</strong> on the top-right corner of the website.</p>
          <p>2. Enter your name, email, and password.</p>
          <p>3. Verify your email to activate your account.</p>
          <p>Once verified, you can browse or list agents on the marketplace.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">3. How do I buy an AI agent?</span>
          </p>
          <p>You can purchase an AI agent by visiting its product page and clicking ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet Agent.‚Äù</p>
          <p>After purchase, you‚Äôll receive access to the agent directly through your dashboard or via your registered email.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">4. Can I sell my own AI agents on Harmonix?</span>
          </p>
          <p>Yes! If you‚Äôre a developer, you can list your AI agents for sale on the platform.</p>
          <p>You‚Äôll need to create a Seller Account, provide a description, upload files or integrations, and set your pricing. Our team reviews each listing before it goes live.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">5. What payment methods do you accept?</span>
          </p>
          <p>We currently support major credit/debit cards and secure online payment gateways.</p>
          <p>Additional payment options (such as crypto or PayPal) may be added in the future.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">6. How do refunds work?</span>
          </p>
          <p>Refunds depend on the type of product purchased.</p>
          <p>Digital items are generally non-refundable once accessed or downloaded, but if there‚Äôs a technical issue, you can contact our support team at <strong>harmonix.hq@gmail.com</strong> for assistance.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">7. Are AI agents safe to use?</span>
          </p>
          <p>We review all listings to ensure they meet our quality and ethical standards.</p>
          <p>However, as AI agents are developed by independent creators, we recommend reviewing the agent‚Äôs description, permissions, and privacy details before purchase.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">8. Can I customize an AI agent I buy?</span>
          </p>
          <p>In most cases, yes. Many agents can be customized or extended depending on the seller‚Äôs terms.</p>
          <p>You can contact the seller directly or request customization through our platform if the option is available.</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">9. How do developers get paid?</span>
          </p>
          <p>Creators receive payouts for each successful sale minus Harmonix‚Äôs transaction or service fee.</p>
          <p>Payouts are processed via secure payment gateways on a set schedule (e.g., weekly or monthly).</p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <span className="title font-bold mb-2 block">10. Who do I contact for support?</span>
